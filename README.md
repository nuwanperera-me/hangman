# Hangman Game ðŸ¤•

A simple Hangman game built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. This project uses `pnpm` as the package manager.

**Live Demo ðŸ‘¾**: [https://hangman-two-delta.vercel.app/](https://hangman-two-delta.vercel.app/)

## Installation

To get started with the project, first ensure you have `pnpm` installed. If you don't have `pnpm` installed, you can install it globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

Then, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hangman-game.git
cd hangman-game
pnpm install
```

## Usage

To run the Hangman game locally, use the following command:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will start the development server and you can view the game by navigating to `http://localhost:5173` in your web browser.

That's it! Happy Coding! ðŸ«°
